Solutions to the equation x^x = a, inspired by a friend's kid's question.

Solve x^x = 55. A friend's kid asked this question to mess with her mother. It inspired me to write this short program solving it a variety of ways. I used the Relaxation method, the binary search method, Netwon's method, and a special function to get the exact answer.
